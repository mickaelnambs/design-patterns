# Design Patterns Project

This project demonstrates how to implement various design patterns in PHP through simple examples. Each pattern is implemented in its own example file for clarity and ease of understanding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have PHP installed on your system. You will also need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage the project dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mickaelnambs/design-patterns
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd design-patterns
    ```

3. Install the dependencies using Composer:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

### Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run any of the design pattern examples. Here are some commands to run different examples:

- **Singleton Pattern Example:**

    ```bash
    php examples/singleton_example.php
    ```

- **Adapter Pattern Example:**

    ```bash
